To build scalable AI-powered algorithms, one needs to understand how to use the tools to build them such as Tensorflow.  
TensorFlow is an open-source framework for machine learning. 
I used TensorFlow to implement machine learning and deep learning principles to build and apply scalable models to real-world problems.
